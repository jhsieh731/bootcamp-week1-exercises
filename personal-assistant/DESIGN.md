## Search Bar
- User input should somehow call todo component to have it filter task name matches

## Common ancestor
- Create list needed for todo and add task

## Todo List
- Ideally a large div with many ul parts
- If no ul parts, component should have some text
- Individual list elements (ul) should probably come from an array of objects. Each object should have id, name
- Delete button should always be rendered at the end of the line; onclick, want to pop object from the array.

## Add task field
- Field and button
- After submit button pressed, we should add new object to main array/list with new unique id and the user's input
